* **Stable** channel is the latest official release.
* **Development** channel usually has newer, shiny features, but also comes with extra bugs and unfinished things.
* **Any other channel is likely for testing upcoming unstable features and should not be used unless you know about the risks involved. Talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/multimc) for more information.**

**Switching back to the stable version can break instances you made or interacted with while using the development version. You get to keep the pieces and put them back together.**

Once you change the channel, check for updates and update:
