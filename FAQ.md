## Minecraft not launching
There are many issues possible for this, here are some issues and solutions.

#### Mods are a different version
Makes sure that all the mods for the instance you are launching is for the version of mc your launching. eg 1.6 mods for mc 1.6, 17 mods for mc 1.7

#### Putting forge/Liteloader mods in jar mods instead of loader mods
Whether you're loading forge mods or liteloader mods, they all need to be added via. loader mods, jar mods are added to the minecraft jar, which only forge=, liteloader & mods **that specifically specify** to be put in the mc jar.

#### Why am I getting weird crashes and/or slow rendering with a NVidia Optimus graphics card on Windows?
There's some blackmagic going on here, try renaming MultiMC.exe to Minecraft.exe.
