Sadly, Mojang removed the page that explains what the service status is/was.

So, here goes:
* `Auth` is authentication services - the stuff you need to log in.
* `Session` is the part that handles game sessions and connection to game servers.
* `Skins` is the skins service. Without it, everyone is Steve.
* `API` is the rest of the Mojang API in general.

And the status goes:
* `Green` - good, probably.
* `Yellow` - we don't know really what it means, but it's worse than `Green`.
* `Red` - it's probably broken.
