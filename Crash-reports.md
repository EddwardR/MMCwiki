There are cases when modders etc. ask you to provide a crash log instead of the full log. If that is the case, follow these instructions:

1. Either on the console window directly after the crash, or in the **Edit Instance** dialog any time after the crash, click on **Other logs**
2. Select the the latest log from the dropdown named like this`crash-reports/crash_<date>_<time>-side>.txt`
3. Upload the log somewhere, there are two ways to go about that:
    * **a.** Click **Upload**. This will upload the log to paste.ee with a 30 day expiration time.
    * **b.** Or you can click **Copy** and manually upload the log to your paste site of choice (pastebin.com, paste.ee, gist, etc.). This might be the better solution if the log needs to stay accessible for a longer period of time.
4. Done.
