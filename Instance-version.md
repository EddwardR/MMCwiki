Here, you can add the various components that make up the base of the instance and change their versions:
* Minecraft
  Almost all versions available can be selected. Changing the Minecraft version will also remove/replace all the other base components.
* LWJGL (not yet implemented)
* Mod loaders - Forge and LiteLoader
  The install buttons are *THE* way to install Forge and LiteLoader in MultiMC. Their original installers do not work here.
* Jar mods
  Mods that you would normally have to add to the minecraft jar file can be added here. Just click the button and select the .jar or .zip file. For jar mods, order in which the mods are added matters. So, you can also reorder them with the 'Move up' and 'Move down' buttons. Mods lower in the list override the ones above them and reflect the order in which you would insert them into the Minecraft jar manually otherwise.
