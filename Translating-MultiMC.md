# How to translate

All the translations are done with the `stable` branch of MultiMC.

For translators, MultiMC supports hotloading of translations from `GetText Portable Object` (`.po`) files.

The workflow:
* Get a `.po` file from here the [translations repository](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate).
  * Alternatively, get the `template.pot` and start a new translation based on it.
  * Alternatively, you can also clone the whole repository using `git`.
* Put it in the `translations` folder.
* Edit it with [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) or a similar editor.
* See the changes in real time. MultiMC reloads the translations whenever something changes in the folder.
* When done, post the changed files on [discord](https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm), or on [github](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate) as a pull request.

If you have any questions feel free to hop on [Discord and talk to us](https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm).
