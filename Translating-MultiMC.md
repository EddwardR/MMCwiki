# How to translate

All the translations are done with the `stable` branch of MultiMC.

The translations use the `GetText Portable Object` format and are stored at [github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate). You can fork the repository, work on the files and then make a pull request with the changes.

Aside from directly editing the files, you can use a [weblate]() based server for translating MultiMC. It is running over at [translate.multimc.org](http://translate.multimc.org). This approach is preferable.

You can suggest translations for the various pieces of text present in MultiMC on the site. Ideally, find someone else speaking the same language to review your suggestions. 

If you have any questions feel free to hop on IRC [#MultiMC on esper.net](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=MultiMC). If no one answers immediately, stick around for a while.
