# How to translate

All the translations are done with the `stable` branch of MultiMC.

The translations use the `GetText Portable Object` format and are stored at [github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate). You can fork the repository, work on the files and then make a pull request with the changes.
