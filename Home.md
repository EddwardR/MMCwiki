Welcome to the MultiMC5 wiki!

MultiMC is a free, open source launcher for Minecraft, managed by [@peterixxx](https://twitter.com/peterixxx).

It allows you to have multiple, separate instances of Minecraft (each with their own mods, texture packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them and their associated options with a simple interface.
