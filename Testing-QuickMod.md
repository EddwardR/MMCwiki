# Beware

The work is far from finished. Expect crashes, bugs, failures and all that.

The format also still receives changes somewhat frequently, so if stuff stops working try to update.

## Setup

1. Go into the settings dialog and change the Update Channel to "QuickMod", then click the check for updates button (or restart).

## Creating an instance with QuickMod support

1. Create a new instance (you really should, don't use an instance you're afraid of losing), preferably with Minecraft 1.6.4
2. Click Edit Mods -> Install, Download/Add QuickMod, check the URL button and enter a QuickMod URL (try `github://02JanDal@QuickMod/index.json`)
3. Check the boxes besides some of the mods
4. Click Install and watch the magic (you may have to click past some adfly links)
5. Launch the instance
