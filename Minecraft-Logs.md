**If someone asks for your log, always use the _Upload_ button**

# Minecraft Log page

This page is available when running an instance. It shows the main minecraft output and updates in real time. It has functions for uploading the log to [paste.ee](http://paste.ee/), copying the log to the clipboard, and clearing the log input (useful if you have a long log).

# The Other Logs page

This page is available both when running the instance and when not. It allows viewing of all detected log files within the current instance, as well as uploading and copying them to the clipboard. You can also clean them, which removes all the logs from the instance.

# Uploading logs

Uploading logs allows you to quickly show them to developers, who can use them to help identify a problem. MultiMC strips personally identifying information (such as your username and session id) from the Minecraft log by default.

By clicking the `Upload` button, the log is uploaded to https://paste.ee - you can then share the link with us or anyone helping you with troubleshooting:

## Usage
1. Click the upload button on the log you wish to upload (could be the main Minecraft Log, or one of the other logs)
2. Wait while MultiMC uploads the necessary logs to [paste.ee](http://paste.ee/).
3. The resulting link is automatically opened in your default browser, or you can click on the link in the pop-up that appears.
