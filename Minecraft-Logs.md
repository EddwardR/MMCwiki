**If someone asks for your log, always use the _Upload_ button**

# Minecraft Log page

This page is available when running an instance. It shows the main minecraft output and updates in real time. It has functions for uploading the log to [paste.ee](http://paste.ee/), copying the log to the clipboard, and clearing the log input (useful if you have a long log).

# The Other Logs page

This page is available both when running the instance and when not. It allows viewing of all detected log files within the current instance, as well as uploading and copying them to the clipboard. You can also clean them, which works the same as with the main Minecraft log.
