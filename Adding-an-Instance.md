MultiMC allows you to add so called instances, they represent independent Minecraft installations and are the main use case of MultiMC.
There's various ways to create new instances including some third-party platform integrations.

## Vanilla instance

Straightforward... Vanilla!
You can select the version you want. (The starred version is the recommended version)
You can also select snapshots, betas and other miscellaneous official versions.
