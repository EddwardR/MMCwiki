MultiMC allows you to add an instance.
You can currently add an instance in 2 ways:

## Vanilla instance

Straightforward... Vanilla!
You can select the version you want. (The Starred version is the recommended version)
You can also select snapshots (If they are available)

## Import modpack/zip instance
used to import twitch modpacks (.zip files) and MultiMC zipped instances
