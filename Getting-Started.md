2. Then you will be prompted for which version of java to use.
 * You should use a 64bit Java if you are on a 64bit OS.
 * If your version of Java does not show up, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/wiki/Report-a-Bug), on our [IRC Channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=MultiMC) or on our [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/98JHQ).
 * If you installed Java elsewhere then click the browse button and browse to the installation

3. MultiMC sends anonymous statistics every time the application starts.This is done for the further development of MultiMC and also to know which platform to focus on more. (You can disable this option)
