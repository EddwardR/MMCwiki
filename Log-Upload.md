Uploading logs allows you to quickly show them to developers, who can use them to help identify a problem. MultiMC strips personally identifying information (such as your username and session id) from your logs by default.

By clicking the `Upload` button, the log is uploaded to https://paste.ee - you can then share the link with us or anyone helping you with troubleshooting:

## Usage
1. Click the upload button on the log you wish to upload (could be the main Minecraft Log, or one of the other logs)
2. Wait while MultiMC uploads the necessary logs to [paste.ee](http://paste.ee/).
3. The resulting link is automatically opened in your default browser, or you can click on the link in the pop-up that appears.
