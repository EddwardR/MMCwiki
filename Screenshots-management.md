Here, you can manage the screenshots Minecraft creates when you press F2 and upload them to imgur.com.

Double clicking the screenshots opens them in your default image viewer (or editor).

Rename and delete affect the local files. Renaming of screenshots is also possible by selecting them and pressing F2.
